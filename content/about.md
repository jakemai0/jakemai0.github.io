Hello world!  
\
My name is Jake, I am a penetration tester working in New Zealand.
With this blog, I hope to share with the community my infosec journey experience, new skills and technique that I've learned along the way. 

My main security area of focus is in Active Directory hacking and AV/EDR bypassing.
