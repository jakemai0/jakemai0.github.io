When the students finish the course and pass the 48 hour exam (don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s not like the 300 level courses by OffSec), the students will receive the &amp;ldquo;Certified Red Team Operator&amp;rdquo; certification. If you&amp;rsquo;re new to the community, Zero Point Security is a one-man company created and operated by Daniel Duggan aka RastaMouse.</description></item><item><title>Pwning Domain Admin with PetitPotam</title><link>https://jakemai0.github.io/posts/petitpotam/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jakemai0.github.io/posts/petitpotam/</guid><description>Disclaimer: Original research was done by Will Schroeder and Lee Christensen in their Certified Pre-Owned whitepaper.

I still need to conduct more research and experiment to fully understand this attack and the underlying technicalities.
Introduction In a recent network pentest, I found an ADCS CA (Active Directory Certificate Services Certificate Authortity) on the target domain. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten a chance to play around with ADCS before, but I did remember reading about one attack technique called PetitPotam that abuses NTLM Relay via ADCS to take over the domain.</description></item></channel></rss>
