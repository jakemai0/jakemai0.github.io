I still need to conduct more research and experiment to fully understand this attack and the underlying technicalities.
Introduction In a recent network pentest, I found an ADCS CA (Active Directory Certificate Services Certificate Authortity) on the target domain. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten a chance to play around with ADCS before, but I did remember reading about one attack technique called PetitPotam that abuses NTLM Relay via ADCS to take over the domain.</description></item></channel></rss>
