Hello world!  
\
My name is Jake, I am an Offensive Security Enthusiast currently living in New Zealand.
With this blog, I hope to share my droplet of knowledge with the community. I will be posting writeups, course reviews, new techniques that I've learned and future security research on my infosec journey.

My main security area of focus is in Active Directory hacking and AV/EDR bypassing.
