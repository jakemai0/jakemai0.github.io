My name is Jake, I am an Offensive Security Enthusiast currently living in New Zealand. With this blog, I hope to share my droplet of knowledge with the community. I will be posting writeups, course reviews, new techniques that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and future security research on my infosec journey.
My main security area of focus is in Active Directory hacking and AV/EDR bypassing.</description></item></channel></rss>
